# Project Requirements:
The goal of this basic project is to "build a CRUD application with the use of supporting tools, techniques, and technologies that encapsulate the essential modules presented during training." This necessitates are,Â the creation of an app that performs the CRUD tasks, which are CREATE, READ, UPDATE, and DELETE.

# The project Scope
- Trello board with user stories
- A database with two table that model a one to many or many to many relationship 
- A python crude app 
- Application testing 
- Front end website built fom flask

# App function
The main function of the app is to keep a list of books you wish to read in the future and and them stored in one place. The app allows you to:
- Add an new author
- Add a new book and link it to the author
-Theres a function where you see a timer next to the book you are currently reading 
- Edit the name of the book or the author associated with the book 
- Finally be able to delete the book from the list once you are done.

# Trello Board
Below is a trello board that displays the user stories for my project as well as all of the project's steps. It has distinct lists that show the various aspects. The following are the details:
- Objective (Shows the objective)
- Project Resources (Where the link to the git repo is)
- User Stories ( To show how the user will benifit from the functions of the app)
- To do (Things still left to do sit in there)
- Done (things all done show in this list)

# Risk assessment
The following screenshot shows the initial risk assesment done on the 17/05/2021 but later it was revisited on the 21/05/2021 after realising a couple more risks.

# Front End Design
Below you can see the home page of the CRUD app. The three links; 'home' brings you back to the home page, 'add a new book' will take you to the page where you can add a new book to the list and lastly the 'add a new author' takes you to the page where yu can add a new author.

# Future improvements 
In the future i want to add a couple more fields within each table for example on where you can add the number of pages in the book and then later add a book mark feature where when you can put down the page number you stopped reading at. This data can then later be used to workout the average reading time of the user and with that information when they add a new book into the list it'll show the user the average time it'll take them to finish the book.
